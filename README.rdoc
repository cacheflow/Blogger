This is the README for my small blogger project. 

Steps to run: 
1. Download the file. 
2. Go to your terminal and run rake db:migrate 
3. After you run rake db:migrate then run rails s to start the server. 
4. Once the server is started, then you can play with the app. 
5. Go to your browser and type in localhost:3000 and now you can create your own blog post.
